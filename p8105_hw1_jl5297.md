Executive Summary
-----------------

This my first-week homework for Data Science, including my solutions to Problems 1 and 2. And I'm praciticing using R Markdown to write reproducible reports, GitHub for version control, and R Projects to organize your work through this homework.

Load Packages
-------------

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Problem 1
---------

### 1. Create a dataframe

Create a data frame comprised of:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
-   A (length-10) character vector
-   A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set.seed(1)
problem1_df = tibble(
    vector_numeric = runif(10, 0, 5),
    vector_logical = vector_numeric > 2,
    vector_character = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    vector_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "male","male","male","male","male","male",
                      "male", "female"))
)
```

### 2. Take the mean

Try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe.

``` r
mean(problem1_df$vector_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 2.757569

``` r
mean(problem1_df$vector_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(problem1_df$vector_character)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$vector_character): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem1_df$vector_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$vector_factor): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

It shows that only numeric and logical variables work. In factor and character, NA is returned. Because taking the mean only can apply to numbers. And logical variable can be interptred in number, false as 0 and true as 1.

### 3. Convert variables

Convert other variables into numeric

``` r
as.numeric(problem1_df$vector_logical)
as.numeric(problem1_df$vector_character)
as.numeric(problem1_df$vector_factor)
```

Logical and factor variables can easily convert into numeric.
Logical: False become 0 and true become 1.
Factor: Factors convert into integers according to their levels.
As for character, character variables containing only a number can be converted into numeric.

Convert character variable from character to factor to numeric. Convert factor variable from factor to character to numeric

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(problem1_df$vector_character))
```

    ##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

``` r
as.numeric(as.character(problem1_df$vector_factor))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

When converting character variable from character to factor to numeric, it can be turned into a integer. When converting factor variable from factor to character to numeric, NA introduced by coercion.
